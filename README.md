#Why_choose_task_6
We wanted to create an app that focused on bringing a community together easier.
Task 6, which was viewing local events, seemed to fullfil this idea best since giving people
a way to see local gathering easier means they are more likely to attend them.

#Feedback_taken
Our orignal design was focused on only showing parks that are local to you, which we were
advised to change since that limits the use of our app and isnt very friendly to users who are differently abled.
So we added a search feature to our map and event viewer.

#key_Elements_Focused_on
We focused on making the creation of reprots and events as easy as possible.
Added both search and sort bottom on the events, gps tracking for user location.
